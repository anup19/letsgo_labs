> Implement a JSON encoder/decoder for a dictionary entry

* Define a dictionary type that contains the following fields:
  * dictionary: the name of the dictionary
  * location: the path where the dictionary was loaded from
  * word: a random word
* Implement a encode function to encode a dictionary entry to JSON
* Implement a decode function to decode raw JSON into a dictionary
* Make sure to test your encode/decode functions completely!
* BONUS! Say the json format is still in flux and you don't want to define
  a custom type yet. Can you figure out another way to implement this?
