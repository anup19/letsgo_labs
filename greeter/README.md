# LetsGo! Test Greeter Lab

## Mission

> Congratulations! You've just got a new gig working at Google!!
> Your PM says we have to speed up the initial greeting page load that's
> being hit by billions of users! The page greets the users with
> a user name and age.

* Using Benchmark tests implement a second version of the greeter and compare
  with your initial version.
* Make sure your new implementation works the same as the old one
* TIP! Another way to concatenate strings is by using the + operator.
* What are your findings?
