# LetsGo! Test Greeter Lab

## Mission

> Using Test first principles, implement a set of tests for your very own greeter function
> that we've written in the fmt lab.

* Use ad-hoc values for name, age, height
* Try out zero-values for name, age, height
* Make use of the assert functions from testify to validate your tests.
* See installation/run steps below
* Practice breaking one of the test on purpose and fixing it.
* Issue a test command to only run one of the tests from the command line!
* Make sure you achieve 100% test coverage using the standard coverage tool.
