# LetsGo! Dictionary Service Lab

---
## <img src="../assets/lab.png" width="auto" height="32"/> Mission

> And that's a Wrap!! Decorate your word dictionary as a Web Service...

* Make sure to leverage your dictionary/jsondic packages for this lab!
* Ensure your web server is listening on port 4500
* Create a HTTP endpoint **/new_word** to serve out new words from a given dictionary
  * The request should take a query parameter ie dic=words or dic=artists
  * You should issue a JSON response!
  * Add a logger to log out your endpoint calls
* In your implementation load the dictionary from the requested dictionary file
* From your *dictionary* package api, load and pick out a random word
* From your *jsondic* package, use the encoder to encode the JSON response
* Make sure the proper JSON headers are set
* Write the necessary tests to shake out your endpoints!
* Run your application and test it using the dictionaries provided in the assets directory
* BONUS! Hit a classmate dictionary service using watch or a shell loop to make sure
  random words are indeed showing up for each requests ;)
