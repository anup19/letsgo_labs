# LetsGo! Fizzbuzz Lab...

## Mission

Leveraging the code from the greeter lab, create a program that
takes in parameters for the user name and age and display the
message. If no flags are specified, the default user is "No one"
and default age is of course 42!

## Usage

```shell
	go run main.go               # => Hello, my name is No one. I am 42 years old!"
	go run main.go -u Fernand    # => Hello, my name is Fernand. I am 42 years old!
	go run main.go -a 21         # => Hello, my name is Nobody. I am 21 years old!
```
