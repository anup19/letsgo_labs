# LetsGo! Testing Fizzbuzz Lab...

## Mission

> Write and test a FizzBuzz game!

* In a FizzBuzz Game, children count up from 1
  * If the number is a multiple of 3, they say **Fizz**
  * If the number is a multiple of 5, they say **Buzz**
  * For multiple of both 3 and 5 they say **FizzBuzz**
  * Otherwise they say the number
* Implement a compute function to translate a number to its FizzBuzz counterpart
* Test your compute function using table testing technique
* Ensure you've achieved complete code coverage!
