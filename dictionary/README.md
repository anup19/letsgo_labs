> Package deal! Implement a word dictionary package

* Create a dictionary dir in your go workspace
  * $GOPATH/src/github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE
* Define a load function to load words from the file system.
* Assume you can load words from different directories and files
* Define a pick function to randomly pick a new word from a list of words
* Write tests and completely document your package
* Ensure you have adequate coverage and you're not exposing too much!
* Next implement a CLI to load words from your dictionary
* The CLI should take in command line args and specify 2 options:
    * A directory where to load the dictionaries from
    * The name of the dictionary to load
    * Ensures it display a new random word on each runs!
* Congratulation!! You've just built a brand new go package!
* BONUS! Change your CLI to reference your classmate repo and run the CLI using
  their implementation
